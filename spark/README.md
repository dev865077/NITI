# cDLC SPARK Proofs

This directory contains SPARK models of the core adaptor algebra used in the
cDLC technical note and in the primary cDLC whitepaper, plus finite financial
product models that prove cDLC settlement accounting over integer units.

There are seven models:

- `cdlc_integer_algebra`: proves the core identities over mathematical
  integers with `SPARK.Big_Integers`. These are polynomial identities. Because
  quotient maps preserve addition and multiplication, the same identities
  transport to arithmetic modulo `n`.
- `cdlc_residue_algebra`: proves the same bridge/adaptor identities over the
  finite residue ring `Z/97Z`, with explicit `mod 97` reduction and no
  `pragma Assume` statements.
- `cdlc_algebra`: proves the same identities using Ada's built-in `type mod 97`.
  This target includes explicit ghost lemmas for modular sum rotation and
  left-cancellation so GNATprove can close the bit-vector modular obligations.
- `lightning_cdlc_algebra`: proves the Lightning companion identities using
  Ada's built-in `type mod 97`: HTLC compatibility under an ideal injective
  hash model, PTLC point locks, HTLC route witness reuse, PTLC route tweaks,
  child activation, timeout/refund abstraction, and channel balance
  conservation.
- `btc_collateral_loan_algebra`: proves the algebraic finance identities for a
  BTC-collateralized loan model over mathematical integers: cross-multiplied
  LTV checks, debt accrual, terminal collateral waterfall, partial liquidation,
  and exact target-LTV restoration under the stated liquidation-size equation.
- `covered_call_yield_note_algebra`: proves the integer payoff and settlement
  identities for BTC covered calls and BTC yield notes: OTM/ITM branch
  partitioning, capped deliverable notional, floor-quotient ITM claim bounds,
  escrowed/upfront conservation, and explicit OTM, ATM, ITM, capped-claim, and
  maximum-delivery vectors.
- `parametric_insurance_algebra`: proves integer accounting for parametric
  insurance and event-linked notes: binary up/down trigger partitioning,
  no-trigger payout, collateral-capped payout boundedness, BTC conservation,
  max-loss cap/collateral behavior, three-region tier partitioning, tiered
  boundedness and conservation, linear attachment/exhaustion floor witnesses,
  USD-indexed ceil witnesses, solvent/insolvent USD-indexed branches, note
  principal waterfalls, escrowed premium/coupon conservation, renewal
  collateral, and aggregate-limit accounting.

## Proven

- Oracle attestation scalar maps to the public attestation point.
- A bridge adaptor signature verifies before completion.
- Adding the oracle scalar completes the signature.
- A completed signature reveals the oracle scalar by subtraction.
- A different oracle scalar does not complete the same bridge signature.
- In the Lightning model, an oracle scalar settles an HTLC when the oracle
  precommits to its payment hash.
- In the Lightning model, the same oracle scalar settles a point-locked PTLC.
- HTLC route locks sharing the same payment hash are redeemed by the same
  oracle witness and reject a wrong witness.
- PTLC hop tweaks preserve route atomicity for one-hop and two-hop routes.
- Correct Lightning witnesses move channel balances while wrong witnesses leave
  the abstract channel state unchanged.
- Timeout/refund predicates activate for wrong witnesses and not after correct
  redemption.
- BTC loan LTV checks are represented by the division-free cross product
  `Debt * LTV_Den <= LTV_Num * Collateral_BTC * Price_USD`.
- A roll preserves BTC collateral and updates debt by
  `Debt + Interest - Repayment`.
- A terminal default waterfall conserves BTC between lender claim and borrower
  residual.
- Partial liquidation weakly reduces both remaining collateral and scaled debt.
- If the exact liquidation-sizing equation holds, the post-liquidation state
  reaches the target LTV in cross-multiplied form.
- Covered-call and yield-note OTM/ITM branches cover all settlement prices and
  do not overlap.
- Capped deliverable notional is bounded by covered notional, cap, and posted
  collateral.
- An ITM quotient witness satisfies the floor-style inequalities
  `Claim * S <= (S - K) * D` and
  `(Claim + 1) * S > (S - K) * D`.
- The ITM buyer claim is bounded by deliverable BTC notional.
- Escrowed premium settlement conserves `Collateral + Premium`; upfront
  premium settlement conserves posted collateral.
- Explicit covered-call test vectors prove OTM, ATM, ITM, capped-claim, and
  maximum-delivery cases.
- Binary up-trigger and down-trigger branches are complete and disjoint.
- No-trigger binary branches pay zero claim and preserve seller collateral.
- Collateral-capped buyer payouts are non-negative and never exceed posted BTC.
- Binary settlement conserves posted BTC.
- Triggered max-loss branches pay the limit when collateral is sufficient and
  exhaust collateral when undercollateralized.
- Three-region tier predicates are complete and disjoint under `T1 < T2`.
- Tiered raw payout is bounded by `Limit` under
  `0 <= Partial <= Limit`, and tiered settlement conserves BTC.
- Linear attachment/exhaustion partial payout witnesses are bounded by
  `Limit`.
- USD-indexed `NeedBTC` witnesses satisfy the ceil-style coverage and minimal
  predecessor inequalities.
- USD-indexed solvent branches cover the target claim; insolvent branches
  exhaust collateral and leave zero residual.
- Investor redemption is bounded by principal, and upfront/escrowed
  event-linked note waterfalls conserve funded BTC.
- No-loss renewal preserves collateral, loss renewal carries residual
  collateral, and aggregate paid loss is monotone and capped.

## Not Proven Here

- The discrete logarithm assumption.
- BIP340 implementation correctness.
- Collision resistance or domain separation of real hash functions.
- Bitcoin transaction serialization, sighash, fee policy, mempool policy, or
  timelock ordering.
- Production Lightning channel state machines, real HTLC preimage security,
  routing policy, liquidity, force-close behavior, watchtowers, or
  point-lock/PTLC deployment.
- Economic claims about stablecoins, collateral, liquidity, oracle markets,
  borrower behavior, lender solvency, real execution price, slippage beyond the
  modeled recovery ratio, option fair value, implied volatility, assignment
  conventions, or legal enforceability.
- Event oracle correctness, event-definition ambiguity, actuarial pricing,
  moral hazard, insurable-interest or insurance-law classification, claims
  adjustment, seller hedging capacity, multi-oracle committee honesty, and
  event-linked note market liquidity.
